## Strategy Overview

### The Competitive Landscape

Based on our competitor analysis, the Centerburg / Knox County market for landscaping and concrete services is severely underserved in terms of SEO. Key findings:

- **Zero competitors** combine landscaping + concrete services with a content-driven website
- **Zero competitors** maintain an active blog or educational content strategy
- The highest-scoring competitor website averages only 3.7/5.0 (Royal Concrete, a Columbus-based company)
- Two direct Centerburg competitors (Delagrange Landscaping, Sedlar Lawncare) have NO website at all
- No competitor targets hyperlocal community keywords for smaller Knox County towns

### The Opportunity

Schultz Landscaping and Concrete LLC can realistically dominate local search within 6-12 months by executing a focused keyword strategy across five categories. The low competitive bar means even moderate SEO investment will yield outsized results.

### Priority Targets

| Priority | Geographic Target | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 (Highest) | Centerburg, OH | Home base. Must own all "Centerburg" keywords. |
| 2 | Mount Vernon, OH | Largest city in Knox County. Highest search volume. |
| 3 | Knox County, OH | County-level captures broad local intent. |
| 4 | Apple Valley / Howard / Gambier | High-income communities, strong demand for outdoor projects. |
| 5 | Danville / Fredericktown / Martinsburg | Smaller communities with zero competitor targeting. |
| 6 | Surrounding counties | Licking, Delaware, Morrow -- expansion opportunities. |

## TOP 5 Money Keywords

These are the keywords most likely to generate actual paying customers. Each one represents a person who has decided they need a service and is looking for someone to hire.

### 1. "concrete contractor Centerburg Ohio"

- **Intent:** Transactional (ready to hire)
- **Competition Level:** LOW -- Only Royal Concrete (Columbus-based) and Central Ohio Concrete have pages targeting this. Neither is truly local.
- **Estimated Monthly Searches:** 20-50 (low volume but extremely high conversion rate)
- **Why It's #1:** Anyone searching this exact phrase is ready to get a quote. Schultz is physically located in Centerburg and can own this keyword with a properly optimized homepage and service pages.
- **Target Page:** Homepage + dedicated Centerburg service area page

### 2. "landscaping Mount Vernon Ohio"

- **Intent:** Transactional / Commercial investigation
- **Competition Level:** MEDIUM -- The Greatest Scape, Dave's Lawn & Cleaning, and TD Landscape compete here, but all have weak content.
- **Estimated Monthly Searches:** 50-100
- **Why It's #2:** Mount Vernon is the Knox County seat and population center. Higher search volume than Centerburg. Competitors have weak websites that can be outranked with quality content.
- **Target Page:** Dedicated Mount Vernon service area page + landscaping service pages

### 3. "concrete driveway Knox County Ohio"

- **Intent:** Transactional (specific service + location)
- **Competition Level:** LOW -- D&R Concrete has a thin Knox County page. No other competitor specifically targets this.
- **Estimated Monthly Searches:** 30-70
- **Why It's #3:** Driveways are the highest-ticket concrete service for residential customers ($5,000-$15,000+). This keyword captures people ready to invest.
- **Target Page:** Dedicated "Concrete Driveways" service page optimized for Knox County

### 4. "landscaping and concrete Centerburg OH"

- **Intent:** Transactional (dual-service need)
- **Competition Level:** ZERO -- No competitor targets this combined query because no competitor offers both services.
- **Estimated Monthly Searches:** 10-30 (low volume but zero competition and very high intent)
- **Why It's #4:** This is Schultz's unique selling proposition. Anyone searching for both services together is the ideal customer. Own this keyword category entirely.
- **Target Page:** Homepage + "Why Choose One Company for Both" content piece

### 5. "stamped concrete patio Centerburg Ohio"

- **Intent:** Transactional (specific high-value service)
- **Competition Level:** LOW -- Royal Concrete mentions stamped concrete for Centerburg but from Columbus. No local competitor targets this.
- **Estimated Monthly Searches:** 20-40
- **Why It's #5:** Stamped concrete patios are premium projects ($3,000-$10,000+). High profit margin. Customers searching for stamped concrete specifically are educated buyers ready to invest.
- **Target Page:** Dedicated "Stamped Concrete" service page with gallery
