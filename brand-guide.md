## Typography

- **Headings:** Bitter (Slab Serif) — Solid, dependable feel matching the trades. Bold weight for headlines, semibold for subheads.
- **Body:** Nunito Sans (Humanist Sans-Serif) — Warm, readable, pairs naturally with slab serifs. Regular weight for body, semibold for emphasis.

Both fonts are served via Google Fonts with `display: swap` for performance.

## Voice & Tone

Straightforward and dependable, like your neighbor who has been doing this work for years. No jargon, no fluff — just honest talk about making your yard look great.

## Logo

Typography-based mark: "S" in a rounded-corner square using the primary green (#2D5A27). Wordmark reads "Schultz" in Bitter Bold with "LANDSCAPING & CONCRETE" as a small-caps subtitle in Nunito Sans.

Works at 32px (favicon) and any display size. No gradients, no clip art.

## Usage Rules

- Primary green is for trust-building elements (header, about section, badges)
- Amber accent is reserved for CTAs and interactive elements only
- Never use amber for large background areas
- Always ensure text on colored backgrounds passes WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large)
- Images on the site should have a slight warm tone to match the earth-toned palette
