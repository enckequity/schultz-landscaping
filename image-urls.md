## Notes for Web Developer

- All Unsplash images are free for commercial use under the [Unsplash License](https://unsplash.com/license). No attribution required, though it is appreciated.
- Append `?w=1200&q=80` for 1200px wide, 80% quality (good for web). Adjust `w=` parameter for different sizes:
  - Hero/full-width: `?w=1920&q=80`
  - Card/thumbnail: `?w=600&q=80`
  - Mobile: `?w=768&q=80`
- Consider using `&auto=format` for automatic WebP delivery where supported.
- These are placeholder/stock images. Replace with actual client project photography when available.
- For the before/after section (#9), real project photos from the client would be much more impactful.
- The brand has no discovered digital presence - all branding (logo, colors, typography) will need to be created fresh or obtained directly from the client.
