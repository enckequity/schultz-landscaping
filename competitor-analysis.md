## Competitor Profiles

### Concrete Contractors

---

#### 1. Knox Concrete Construction

- **URL:** https://knoxconcrete.com/
- **Location:** Mount Vernon, OH
- **In Business Since:** 2007
- **Services:** General and concrete contracting, residential and commercial
- **Service Area:** Knox, Richland, and Licking Counties

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 3 | Professional Divi theme; clean but generic. Lacks portfolio imagery on homepage. |
| SEO Score | 3 | Proper schema markup, breadcrumbs, and geo-targeted title tag. No blog, no content depth. |
| Content Depth | 2 | Minimal page content. Service descriptions are thin. No educational content. |

**Key Weakness:** The website looks professional at first glance but has almost no substance. No testimonials, no project gallery, no blog, and no detailed service pages. A competitor with rich content will easily outrank them for informational queries.

---

#### 2. D&R Concrete Solutions, LLC

- **URL:** https://drconcretesolutions.com/
- **Location:** Mount Vernon, OH (serves Knox County)
- **Experience:** 20+ years
- **Services:** Residential driveways, garages, patios, sidewalks, basements; commercial warehouses, offices, hospitals; floor coating (epoxy/polyurethane)
- **Service Area:** 11 Ohio counties (Knox, Franklin, Licking, Delaware, Coshocton, Fairfield, Morrow, Muskingum, Perry, Pickaway, Richland)

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 3 | Dark professional theme with concrete imagery. Functional but dated feel. |
| SEO Score | 4 | Strong multi-county service area page strategy. Schema markup. Individual county pages. |
| Content Depth | 3 | Floor coating content is solid. Other service descriptions are generic. No blog. |

**Key Weakness:** Despite having individual county service pages (a smart SEO move), the content on those pages is thin and generic -- three bullet points that could apply to any contractor. No testimonials on the site; they rely on directing users to Google/Facebook instead. No blog.

---

#### 3. Royal Concrete

- **URL:** https://royalconcreteoh.com/
- **Location:** Columbus, OH (serves Centerburg)
- **Experience:** 5+ years
- **Services:** Driveways, sidewalks, patios, garage slabs, pool decks, stamped concrete, broom finish, exposed aggregate, fire pits, seating walls
- **Service Area:** Columbus metro including Centerburg, Bexley, Dublin, Worthington, Powell

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 4 | Modern Elementor build, video backgrounds, tabbed content, strong visuals. Best-designed concrete site in the market. |
| SEO Score | 4 | Individual city service pages (including Centerburg), schema markup, analytics tracking, internal linking. Has a cost guide blog post. |
| Content Depth | 3 | Decent service descriptions with benefit statements. Has a "concrete driveway cost" article. Still missing FAQ, comparison content, and consistent blogging. |

**Key Weakness:** They are a Columbus-based company extending reach to Centerburg. This creates a "local trust" gap -- a Centerburg-based company can position itself as the truly local option. Their blog has only a few posts, and they lack testimonials on their service area pages. No FAQ section.

---

#### 4. Central Ohio Concrete Construction

- **URL:** https://www.centralohioconcreteoh.com/
- **Location:** Mount Vernon, OH
- **Experience:** 22+ years (owner Brandon Sturtz)
- **Services:** Flatwork, driveways, patios, retaining walls, structural concrete
- **Service Area:** Knox County, Licking County, surrounding areas

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 2 | Basic website. Functional but not visually impressive. |
| SEO Score | 3 | Has city-specific pages (Centerburg page exists). Basic schema. |
| Content Depth | 2 | Thin content. Service pages lack detail. No blog. |

**Key Weakness:** Despite 22 years of experience, the website does not reflect that expertise. No portfolio, no case studies, no testimonials, and minimal content. A well-built website with rich content would significantly outperform them in search.

---

#### 5. Generations Concrete & Construction

- **URL:** https://www.generationsconcrete.us/
- **Location:** Centerburg, OH (176 County Rd)
- **Owner:** Jordan Sapp
- **Services:** Driveways, sidewalks, patios, stamped concrete, ICF walls
- **Service Area:** Central Ohio (Columbus, Granville, Centerburg)

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 4 | Modern Squarespace template, clean layout, green branding, animated sections. |
| SEO Score | 2 | Basic schema markup only. No blog, no service area pages, minimal keyword optimization. |
| Content Depth | 1 | Extremely shallow. Homepage has brief philosophy text only. No detailed service descriptions. |

**Key Weakness:** This is the most direct local competitor (Centerburg-based), but their website is almost empty in terms of content. Their "Request a Quote" button has at times redirected to a "no longer accepting estimates" page. They rely on Instagram for portfolio instead of their website. Heavy reliance on word-of-mouth with no online content strategy.

---

#### 6. Maxima Concrete LLC

- **URL:** https://www.maximaconcrete.com
- **Location:** Delaware, OH (serves Centerburg)
- **Services:** Driveways, patios, steps, porches, sidewalks, curbs, garage/barn floors, stamped/colored concrete, exposed aggregate
- **Service Area:** Columbus, Delaware, Sunbury, Galena, Centerburg

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 3 | Wix-built site. Modern template but Wix limitations on performance/SEO. |
| SEO Score | 2 | Wix platform inherently limits SEO. JavaScript-heavy rendering. |
| Content Depth | 2 | Basic service listings. No blog, no educational content. |

**Key Weakness:** Built on Wix, which has inherent SEO limitations (JavaScript rendering, slow page speed). No blog, no testimonials section, and no location-specific content targeting Centerburg or Knox County.

---

### Landscaping Companies

---

#### 7. The Greatest Scape

- **URL:** https://greatestscape.com/
- **Location:** Mount Vernon, OH 43050
- **Experience:** 28+ years

- **Service Area:** Knox County and surrounding areas

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 3 | Clean WordPress/GeneratePress theme. Earth tone palette appropriate for industry. Image slider. |
| SEO Score | 3 | LocalBusiness schema, breadcrumbs, mobile-responsive. Limited keyword targeting beyond brand. |
| Content Depth | 2 | Homepage is thin. Brief value proposition. Limited detail on service pages. |

**Key Weakness:** Despite 28 years in business, the website doesn't leverage that experience with case studies, project galleries with descriptions, or educational content. No blog. The testimonials page exists in navigation but is not prominently featured. No contact form visible on homepage -- phone-only CTA limits conversions.

---

#### 8. Dave's Lawn & Cleaning Service

- **URL:** https://daveslawnandcleaning.com/
- **Location:** Mount Vernon, OH (12931 Gilchrist Rd)
- **Experience:** 16 years
- **Services:** Lawn mowing, landscape maintenance, spring/fall cleanups, gutter cleaning, hauling
- **Service Area:** Mount Vernon, Gambier, Apple Valley, surrounding areas

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 2 | Basic WordPress site. Grass graphic header. Functional but dated. |
| SEO Score | 2 | Basic schema, Google Analytics. Minimal keyword optimization. |
| Content Depth | 1 | Very shallow. Basic service descriptions only. No detail pages. |

**Key Weakness:** Extremely basic website that does not differentiate the business in any way. No testimonials, no blog, no project photos, no pricing info. Still has an outdated Google+ social link. They are not a direct competitor for concrete/hardscaping, but they compete for lawn and maintenance customers.

---

#### 9. Strait Kut Landscaping and Lawn Care

- **URL:** https://straitkut.biz/
- **Location:** Central Ohio (near Centerburg)
- **Services:** Full-service lawn care
- **Service Area:** Central Ohio

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 2 | Basic small-business website. Not visually competitive. |
| SEO Score | 2 | Minimal SEO optimization. Basic presence only. |
| Content Depth | 1 | Very limited content. |

**Key Weakness:** Bare-bones web presence. No real content strategy, no portfolio, no testimonials. Competes primarily on word-of-mouth and directory listings.

---

#### 10. TD Landscape

- **URL:** https://www.tdlandscape.net/
- **Location:** Fredericktown, OH
- **Experience:** 35+ years combined; includes Master Gardener, Ohio Certified Nursery Technician, Licensed Commercial Pesticide Applicators
- **Services:** Landscaping for residential and commercial clients
- **Service Area:** Fredericktown, Bellville, Mount Vernon, Mansfield, Delaware, Marion

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 3 | Professional appearance. Credentials-focused. |
| SEO Score | 3 | Multi-city targeting in content. Professional credentials add authority. |
| Content Depth | 3 | Better than most -- leverages credentials and certifications. |

**Key Weakness:** Strong credentials but the website does not fully capitalize on them with detailed content, case studies, or a blog strategy. No focus on Centerburg specifically.

---

#### 11. Delagrange Landscaping

- **URL:** No dedicated website (listed on directories only)
- **Location:** 6715 Bloomfield Rd, Centerburg, OH 43011
- **Contact:** (740) 627-0543
- **Services:** Mowing, mulching, spring/fall cleanups, patios, retaining walls, tree planting
- **Service Area:** Central Ohio

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 0 | No website. Directory listings only. |
| SEO Score | 1 | Relies entirely on directory aggregators (Angi, Yellow Pages, etc.). |
| Content Depth | 0 | No owned content anywhere. |

**Key Weakness:** A Centerburg-based competitor with NO website. They have a 4/5 rating on Angi but cannot be found organically. Any business with a website will automatically capture the traffic Delagrange cannot.

---

#### 12. Sedlar Lawncare & Landscaping

- **URL:** Nextdoor page only (no dedicated website)
- **Location:** Sunbury, OH (serves Centerburg)
- **Services:** Mowing, landscaping, tree removal/stump grinding, junk hauling, material delivery
- **Service Area:** Centerburg, Sunbury, surrounding areas

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 0 | No website. Nextdoor presence only. |
| SEO Score | 1 | Zero organic search presence. |
| Content Depth | 0 | No owned content. |

**Key Weakness:** Another competitor with no website. They exist only on Nextdoor with 6 favorites. Any SEO investment will immediately surpass them.

---

### Dual-Service Competitors (Landscaping + Concrete/Hardscaping)

#### 13. Double A Services

- **URL:** https://doubleaohio.com/
- **Location:** Marengo, OH
- **Services:** Paver patios, retaining walls, walkways, driveways, firepits, lawn installations, tree/hedge planting, drainage, landscape lighting
- **Service Area:** Knox and Morrow Counties, Johnstown, Galena, Sunbury

| Metric | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|:-----------:|-------|
| Design Quality | 3 | Modern design with green/orange brand colors. Image-driven layout. |
| SEO Score | 3 | Geo-targeted title tag (Johnstown, Galena, Sunbury). Form-based CTA. |
| Content Depth | 2 | Visually appealing but light on text content. No blog. No reviews on site. |

**Key Weakness:** Targets Johnstown/Galena/Sunbury in their title tag but NOT Centerburg or Knox County specifically. They do serve the area but aren't optimizing for it. Their content is image-heavy but text-light, meaning a text-rich competitor will outrank them for most search queries.

| Double A Services | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2.7 | Doesn't target Centerburg in SEO |

**Market Average Score: 2.1 / 5.0**

**Insight:** The competitive bar in this market is remarkably low. The highest-scoring competitor (Royal Concrete at 3.7) is a Columbus-based company, not a true local player. Among genuinely local competitors, the best average score is only 3.3 (D&R Concrete). Two direct Centerburg competitors have NO website at all. This is a wide-open opportunity.

---

## Keyword Opportunities Competitors Are Missing

### Top 3 Keyword Gaps

#### 1. "Landscaping AND Concrete" Combined Service Keywords

**No competitor in this market positions themselves as both a landscaping AND concrete company.** Every single competitor is either landscaping-only or concrete-only. Schultz Landscaping and Concrete LLC has a massive opportunity to own the combined-service keyword space:
- "landscaping and concrete Centerburg Ohio"
- "landscaping and concrete contractor Knox County"
- "one company for landscaping and concrete Ohio"
- "full outdoor renovation Centerburg OH"

These keywords have ZERO competition from any analyzed competitor.

#### 2. Informational / Problem-Solving Content Keywords

Not a single competitor in this market has a meaningful blog or educational content strategy. The following high-intent informational keywords are completely uncontested:
- "how much does a concrete driveway cost in Knox County Ohio"
- "best time to pour concrete in Ohio"
- "how to plan a backyard patio project"
- "concrete vs pavers for Ohio driveways"
- "landscape design ideas for central Ohio homes"
- "how long does a stamped concrete patio last"

Royal Concrete has ONE blog post about driveway costs (targeting Columbus). Nobody is targeting Knox County / Centerburg for these queries.

#### 3. Hyperlocal Community Keywords

No competitor is targeting the smaller communities within Knox County. These are wide open:
- "concrete contractor Apple Valley Ohio"
- "landscaping Howard Ohio"
- "driveway replacement Gambier OH"
- "patio installation Danville Ohio"
- "retaining wall contractor Fredericktown OH"
- "landscaping Martinsburg Ohio"
- "concrete work Bladensburg OH"

D&R Concrete has county-level pages but NOT individual community pages for these smaller Knox County towns.

---

## Design/UX Gaps We Can Exploit

### 1. No Competitor Has an Online Quote Calculator or Estimator
Every competitor relies on "call for a free estimate" or a basic contact form. An interactive concrete/landscaping cost estimator tool would be a massive differentiator and lead magnet.

### 2. No Competitor Has Before/After Project Galleries with Details
Some competitors have basic image galleries, but NONE have structured before/after comparisons with project details (scope, timeline, materials, approximate cost range). This is the #1 thing homeowners want to see.

### 3. No Competitor Has Video Content on Their Website
Zero competitors feature video walkthroughs of completed projects, video testimonials, or process explanation videos. Video content dramatically increases time-on-site and conversion rates.

### 4. No Competitor Has a Proper FAQ Section
Not one competitor addresses common customer questions in a structured FAQ format. This is easy to create and captures significant "People Also Ask" traffic from Google.

### 5. No Competitor Offers Online Scheduling
Every competitor is phone-call-only or basic contact form. An integrated scheduling tool (even a simple Calendly embed) for consultations would reduce friction and increase conversions, especially for younger homeowners.

### 6. Mobile Experience Is Mediocre Across the Board
While most sites are technically responsive, none are mobile-optimized with tap-to-call buttons, sticky CTAs, or fast-loading mobile pages. Given that 60%+ of local searches happen on mobile, this is a significant gap.

### 7. No Competitor Showcases Financing Options Prominently
Concrete and landscaping projects can cost $5,000-$20,000+. No competitor prominently features financing options, payment plans, or helps customers understand their investment. Royal Concrete hints at financing but doesn't detail it.

---

## The #1 Thing We Can Do That None of Them Are Doing

### Build a Content-Rich, Dual-Service Authority Website with Hyperlocal SEO

**None of these competitors combine landscaping + concrete under one roof with a content-driven SEO strategy.**

Here is the specific play:

1. **Position as the ONLY company that does both landscaping AND concrete** -- this is Schultz's natural advantage and no competitor can claim it. Create a clear brand message: "One team for your entire outdoor project -- from concrete to landscaping."

2. **Create individual service pages for every service** (stamped concrete, driveways, patios, retaining walls, lawn care, landscape design, grading, etc.) -- each page targeting "[service] Centerburg Ohio" and "[service] Knox County."

3. **Create individual location pages for every community served** (Centerburg, Mount Vernon, Gambier, Howard, Apple Valley, Danville, Fredericktown, Martinsburg, Bladensburg, Utica, Johnstown) -- each page with unique localized content, not just find-and-replace city names.

4. **Launch a blog publishing 2-4 posts per month** covering cost guides, project planning tips, seasonal maintenance advice, material comparisons, and local project showcases. This is the #1 thing no competitor is doing and it will compound SEO authority over time.

5. **Feature rich project case studies** with before/after photos, scope of work, timeline, and customer testimonials. Make these the centerpiece of the site.

6. **Add an interactive cost estimator** to capture leads who aren't ready to call but want to understand pricing.

**Why this wins:** The average competitor scores 2.1/5.0. Royal Concrete is the strongest at 3.7/5.0 but they are Columbus-based and not a dual-service provider. A Schultz website that executes this strategy would score 4.5-5.0/5.0 and would likely dominate local search within 6-12 months due to the extremely low competitive bar.
